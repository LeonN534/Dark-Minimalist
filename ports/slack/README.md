## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to Slack's new
> [redesign](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/productivity/a-redesigned-slack-built-for-focus),
> the theme strings don't directly apply the
> palette, and instead they are mapped to Slack's built-in colors. However, the
> theme strings work as intended on older versions of Slack.

### Redesign

### Legacy

1. Open Slack Desktop, click your profile picture in the top right.
2. Head to `Preferences` → `Themes`
